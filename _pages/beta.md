## General Details

This is the Beta page for Bills io for macOS. Here you can find the latest build and general notes of changes. If you have issues, file a bug report above. This app is available in both iCloud syncing and Local versions. The local version can be run and installed along-side your existing application. If you are worried about non-released code affecting your data, choose the local version.

Thanks and enjoy the preview!

## Builds

Move to `/Applications`. Local Data Only builds do not use iCloud for syncing between devices, and it only stores the data locally. It also uses a different URL scheme `billsio-debug://` in order for it to be installed alongside the regular iCloud Syncing release.
